## LABORATORY WORK â„–1

  ### task 1

  Build a confidence interval for:
      -  expected value in the assumption that there are random variables
              that have a normal distribution, but the variance is unknown.
      -  expected value in the assumption that there are random variables
              whose distribution is unknown.
      -  variance in the assumption that there are random variables
              that have a normal distribution.

  ### task 2

  Calculate the integral in four ways and estimate the rates of convergence.
