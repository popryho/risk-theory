# Methods of reliability and risk theory

## LABORATORY WORK №1

  ### task 1

  Build a confidence interval for:
  
      -  expected value in the assumption that there are random variables
              that have a normal distribution, but the variance is unknown.
      -  expected value in the assumption that there are random variables
              whose distribution is unknown.
      -  variance in the assumption that there are random variables
              that have a normal distribution.

  ### task 2

  Calculate the integral in four ways and estimate the rates of convergence.


## LABORATORY WORK №2

The statistical hypothesis tests about the type of distribution, and the hypothesis of homogeneity.

Draw samples from an exponential distribution with different scale parameters and check hypothesis with the determined 
significance level for different sample lengths.

### task 1 
    - Check hypothesis using the KOLMOGOROV test
### task 2
    - Check hypothesis using the CHI-SQUARE test
### task 3
    - Check hypothesis using the EMPTY-BOXES test
### task 4
    - Check hypothesis using the one-sided SMIRNOV homogeneity test.
